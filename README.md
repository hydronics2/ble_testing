# ble_testing

Modified the puck.js file from found https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Web+Bluetooth

Modified the file to add options.acceptAllDevices = true; so that any ble device shows up. 

Works on Chrome in Mac/Windows/Android.  Does not work on the WebBle ios app on an ipad running 10.3.2. Any help?
